    Goto Python-2.7.5, and "./configure" this will config for mac OSX plaform, but still can make next of your steps easier.
  
    Create a static library project, then add all python file into project with directory structure.
    
    while( build_not_successed )
    {
        Try to build it, and you will found some source file are not for iOS platform, remove these files, and some other files
      failed to compile because missing other 3rd party libs, remove it from the project , or provide the libs.
    }
    
    you will get a python interpet with some useful builtin modules.
    
    manually edit the Modules/config.c to register built-in modules, you see how, when you open the config.c it's easy to understand
    module "zlib" must be registered in order to import for a zip file.
    
    and in python/libs/site.py there comment line "known_paths = addusersitepackages(known_paths)" , that depends a module called "_sysconfigdata", this module is generated when you make python in commandline, so this funciton call should be disabled
  
    that's all I remember...
